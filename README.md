# Project 16: Forecasting Telecom Customer Retention and Churn
 
**Objective:** To develop a machine learning model for the telecom operator Interconnect that uses data of customers' contract details, internet usage, phone usage, and demographic information to predict customer churn, thereby allowing Interconnect to offer promotional codes and special plan options to customers who are expected to leave.

**Accomplishment:** To pass this project, the final model must acquire an AUC-ROC value of at least 0.85. My final model, a CatBoostClassifier, acquired a value of 0.947 on the test set.

**Skills Demonstrated:** Data preparation, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, model evaluation, and feature importance analysis
